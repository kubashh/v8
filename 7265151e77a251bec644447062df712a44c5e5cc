The checks in Builtin_KeyedStoreIC_Transition is still simpler than the `CodeStubAssembler::TryToName` heuristic in Megamorphic state. We can also further optimize them in Maglev/Turbofan because we know that the key is guaranteed to be a unique name. Avoiding these checks bring +8% more gain to the microbench.",

We could also consider tightening the fast path to simple transitioning fast data stores, make the builtin return just the map (or 0 on a miss), and emit the actual field store in the optimized code. Something like this would have the big advantage that we can guarantee that the store has no side effects, which could help with optimising the surrounding code.\n\nThere\u0027s a couple of different options here and they\u0027re all worth exploring and benchmarking against each other.",
