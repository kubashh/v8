That predecessor change isn\u0027t yet landed, but it\u0027s only waiting on one OWNER review for a small portion so I don\u0027t expect any major merge conflicts with this change. Even so, it\u0027s fine if you\u0027d prefer to hold off reviewing until the predecessor has landed.\n\nNico: src/torque\nJakob: everything else",

      "message": "I\u0027m slightly concerned about how implicit much about these uses is:\n\n- The torque-generated struct is always used as \u0027auto\u0027 (getters) and constructed with the \u0027{}\u0027 syntax (setters). Without understanding how torque generates these things, readers will have no idea what goes on in these invisible types, without looking into the out/x/gen/ directory.\n- The setter style doesn\u0027t specify field names. You improved this somewhat by adding them in comments, but still, future refactors of struct layout will be hard (tedious, manual updates, unchecked). For example, think of swapping the order of two fields with the same type. Or renaming a field.\n- The Optional-based interface to set only some fields is not totally obvious, yet the definition is hidden in out/x/gen/ and the use-sites are non-obvious either with the \u0027{{}, {}, x}\u0027 style syntax.\n\n(Maybe you can tell I prefer the old world where all definitions where in plain old C++ files :)",

      "message": "Great feedback, thanks! First, a few specific replies:\n\n- `auto` on getters: do you think it would be sufficient to spell out the generated struct name? Instead of `auto`, `TqRuntimeStructCoverageInfoSlot` for example.\n- setter field names: my first implementation of this used designated initializers (a C++ 20 feature, but supported with our Clang build options and allowed by the Google style guide). I really like designated initializers for exactly the reasons you listed, but alas, that implementation failed on the MSVC and GCC build bots. I considered adding a macro V8_DI(field_name, field_value) which would expand to designated-initializer syntax `.field_name \u003d field_value` when building with Clang and to just `field_value` on other build targets. Do you think that would help? I was concerned that such a change might further decrease readability unless it was used commonly elsewhere. (For the record, I would be in full support of a lint rule requiring designated initializers for all aggregate initializations throughout V8.) Dreams of designated initializers aside, perhaps we could mitigate this problem by setting each field, like:\n\n  TqRuntimeOptionalStructCoverageInfoSlot coverage_info;\n  coverage_info.start_source_position \u003d from_pos;\n  coverage_info.end_source_position \u003d to_pos;\n  coverage_info.block_count \u003d 0;\n  coverage_info.padding \u003d 0;\n  set_slots(slot_index, coverage_info);\n\n- non-obvious Optional-based setters with `{}`: good point, this is pretty unclear. Maybe it would help to define a constant named something like `TorqueStructs::kNoChange` that is set to base::Optional\u0027s equivalent of std::nullopt.\n\nSo far, everything I\u0027ve written here is about small details of how to use these accessors. But it sounds like we should take a step back to consider what I\u0027m hoping to accomplish, whether we find it valuable, and whether there are other alternatives that could provide similar benefits with fewer problems.\n\nMy goals:\n\n- I\u0027d like compilation to fail if any field is used in C++ runtime code in a way that is inconsistent with its Torque definition. Using Torque-generated offsets gets us partway there, but I\u0027d also like a compile-time guarantee that the types match.\n- I\u0027d like more consistency in what we can expect Torque to generate. Currently it generates accessors for most class fields; I\u0027d prefer for it to include all class fields.\n\nAre those goals worthwhile? I don\u0027t know. Some valid counterarguments:\n\n- V8 has a very robust test suite, which means it\u0027s fine for some classes of bugs to be invisible to the compiler. DCHECKs on casts and Torque-generated heap verifiers mean that most type mismatches would get caught during testing.\n- \"Torque generates accessors for all class fields\" sounds nice and consistent, but if struct-typed fields (which are a very small minority) have a new set of arcane rules to learn, then the overall consistency is harmed rather than improved.\n\nAlternate idea:\n\nInstead of Torque generating accessors, maybe it could just generate a list of `using` statements that give descriptive names for each type used within a struct field. Then the C++ side could implement the field accessors and include sufficient static assertions that the types match.\n\nDo you have recommendations? My preference is still for generating accessors so we don\u0027t have to spend cognitive effort on checking whether all of the appropriate static assertions exist and are up-to-date, but I recognize that my idea of the level of cognitive effort may be distorted because I\u0027m familiar with the Torque compiler and the code it produces. A valid decision is just to not do any of this.",
