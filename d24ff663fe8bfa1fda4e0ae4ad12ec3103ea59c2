      "message": "I think that we should compile concurrent OSR code objects in a way that they have multiple entries for the different nested loops. This would be better than to re-try optimization with different entries. And normally, it shouldn\u0027t increase code-size much, multiple loops in sequence as in the example are almost for free. In some cases, we might have to peel a bit more to make things reducible, but compared to re-triggering optimization, it should still be better and more reliable.",
