      "message": "Adding Sigurd on cc because I believe he\u0027s been thinking about this more than I have.\n\nAs of https://crrev.com/c/v8/v8/+/1607645 , Torque now generates a small handful of instance types for classes that are defined entirely in Torque without any corresponding C++ class. Ideally it could generate the entire InstanceType enum, automatically grouping together subclasses for range checks, but there are a lot of interesting special cases:\n- string type flags are somewhat complicated\n- we must somehow leave gaps or define instance types for classes that aren\u0027t defined in Torque (this list should be dwindling, but there are still some)\n- some values are fixed because the V8 public API exposes them\n- some types need to be ordered last within their supertype so we can do one-sided range checks (JSObject, JSReceiver)\n- some instance types are currently ordered by something other than their superclass (for example, FixedArrayBase subclasses are pretty scattered), and I\u0027m not sure what I would break by trying to clump them together\n\nThe other option I can see is to keep the InstanceType enum defined in C++ and generate this macro based on simple text manipulation of the Torque-defined class names. The existing annotations @abstract and @hasSameInstanceTypeAsParent tell us much of what we need to know here, but we would need additional information defining what to do in cases such as:\n- JSLocale (whose instance type doesn\u0027t perfectly match its name)\n- ConsString (which isn\u0027t included in this list since it could have either of two instance types)\n- PrototypeInfo (which isn\u0027t included in this list because it\u0027s in STRUCT_LIST_GENERATOR)",
