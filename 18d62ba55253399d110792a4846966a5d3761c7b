      "message": "As far as I understand, this CL allocates the whole signature object including types array in one allocation, whereas the original code with the Signature::Builder uses two allocations. Nice find! One question though: Could you not just have done this refactoring in the Signature::Builder, so that all uses of Signature::Builder benefit from the change? The Signature::Builder seems to be a nice design pattern, and not inherently the issue here. As far as I understand the code, it is not necessary to inline the builder code in the CallDescriptor code manually.\n\nThe other small cleanups are naturally nice though.",

      "message": "You did several great optimizations and cleanups here, which make the code more readable and faster. Indeed, the call to `FunctionSigToMachineSig` was unnecessary, and introducing `has_tagged_param` was a great idea. But the last step, to also eliminate `Signature::Builder`, is unnecessary, and it\u0027s better to just optimize `Signature::Builder`, as you do it in https://crrev.com/c/4138268.\n\nI don\u0027t agree that `Signature::Builder` is an unnecessary abstraction. It hides all the memory management, and all the pointer arithmetic. I mean, by removing the `Signature::Builder` you require from the reader of the code to know the internal memory layout of a `Signature`, whereas with the `Signature::Builder` it is sufficient to know what a signature is.\n\nYou could argue that the `++param_locations;` makes the code cleaner and avoids the `+ param_offset` in the original code. But I would argue that this actually hides important information in this function and may make the reader misunderstand the code: if you glance at the code quickly it looks like parameter 3 gets written into position 3, whereas actually it gets written into position 4 in the parameter array.\n\nOverall I think this is a great CL with many improvements, but removing `Signature::Builder` in `BuildLocations` is a bit too much. \n\nIf you can measure a big enough performance advantage of writing to the array directly, then I\u0027m okay with the change. In that case we may want to question the `Signature::Builder` in general.",
