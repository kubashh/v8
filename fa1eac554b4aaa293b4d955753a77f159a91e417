      "message": "I tried to get one projection to be used in a few ways, but I haven\u0027t gotten it to fail. I\u0027ve added a sample test here - https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/1195910/6/test/cctest/wasm/test-run-wasm-atomics64.cc#441\n\nNot sure what I\u0027m missing, my understanding of it is that for the i64-\u003ei32 conversion cases, the entire i64 value is fed into the conversion node, so it cannot be partially optimized?",

Then the upper half of the AtomicLoad64 might die.\n\nI think this can only occur on 32-bit platforms.",
