      "message": "I started turning the V8Provider into a derived class of Recorder. In doing so, I changed V8Provider from being a global into a shared_ptr that lives in the Isolate and is initialized from within Isolate::Initialize. I also added a sample logging event (the Compile event) so we can have an idea of what add events looks like in the source code. Here are some notes (don\u0027t know if I should include this in the Issue, so I\u0027ll do both):\n  - The Isolate already had a SetMetricsRecorder member, so I used that to initialize the recorder. However, this implies that an Isolate can ever only have one recorder, and I can imagine scenarios where we would want more than one. For example, we may want to turn on both ETW and v8.log logging.\n  - I don\u0027t understand the difference between V8::Isolate and V8::internal::Isolate. On the one hand, I see them being used differently (see src/api/api.cc, Isolate::Initialize), where some things are initialized on the V8::Isolate and some things are initialized on the internal one. On the other hand, I also see them being cast back and forth (see src/logging/metrics.cc, Recorder::SetRecorder and the function that calls it, src/api/api.cc Isolate::SetMetricsRecorder).\n  - This kind of follows up from the previous point, but when we call AddMainThreadEvent from src/compiler/compile.cc, we\u0027re doing a lot of work before we actually do the function call: grabbing the context ID, creating the event, etc. I\u0027m open to ideas for how to make this part of the code more streamlined.",

The naming is a bit confusing at times. Outside of V8 (as an API owner) you only have only access to v8::Isolate, within the API (in api.cc) you can cross over to v8::internal::Isolate.
