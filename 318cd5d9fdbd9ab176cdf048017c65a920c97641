      "message": "Hello,\n\nThis is fixing building V8 on systems with 64k OS pages, as reported here https://groups.google.com/g/v8-users/c/4fqKPZddyMw/m/jwI3HLeyBwAJ . As well as making sure that we don\u0027t fill the regular code pages with a small number of large objects.\n\nWDYT? \n\nOriginally, I was going to fix this by switching to 512k heap pages for Arm64 linux, but it\u0027s really a shame to make regular linux different from ChromeOS and Android. Systems with 64k OS pages are less common than those with 4k, and will typically have a lot of memory available so it shouldn\u0027t be an issue to stick to 256k V8 code pages, even if only 64k can be used for allocation.\n\nThanks,\nPierre",
