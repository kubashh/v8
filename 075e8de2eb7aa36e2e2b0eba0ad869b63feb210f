      "message": "Is `gerrit_util.CherryPick` patching a CL? My understanding is that this script creates a new cherry-picked CL targeting the identified branch only.\n\nIf the script is only used to unblock roll CLs which cannot land, this makes sense. If we accept `new` and `merged` here, we update the most recently rolled branch, independent of being landed already?\n\nI am also wondering if a prompt could make sense to confirm that the dev really wanted to target this branch. It might happen that we have the most recent roll 11.5.49 (status new), and a newer cherry-pick on 11.5.40.1 (status new). The dev might plan to target 11.5.49, while he actually creates a cherry-pick on branch 11.5.40.",
