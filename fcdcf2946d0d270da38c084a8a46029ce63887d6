Please look through the CL for my changes, but I guess the my main question is that I don\u0027t know a reliable way to distinguish between MainThreadEvents and ThreadSafeEvents from within TimedScope.",

      "message": "Initially, the if-statement in ~TimedScope that calls Add*Event would fail at compile-time bc each event is only defined for one of AddMainThreadEvent/AddThreadSafeEvent.\n\nThe workaround I landed on was to define both AddMainThreadEvent and AddThreadSafeEvent for all events, but throw an error for the one we don\u0027t expect. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t know how to throw errors in /include so help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnd also open to other ideas on how to get the Add*Event working from within ~TimedScope.",
